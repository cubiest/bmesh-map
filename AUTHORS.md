# BMesh Map authors

BMesh Map was initially developed by Cubiest GmbH and is being continued by voluntary contributors who
commit code patches, report bugs, add to or improve documentation, etc.

The following list aims at mentioning all developers who made significant contributions
to the source code. "Significant" means several merged commits that add or enhance features
or fix issues.  
The number and size of required commits is undefined, but the final decision should be fair.
